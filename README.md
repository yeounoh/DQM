# Data Quality Metric (DQM)
Estimating the number of renaining errors in a dataset is an important problem. Previously (http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p1094-chung.pdf), we have shown that some heuristic estimators can provide useful estimates to guide the data cleaning process (e.g., know when to stop cleaning). In this work, we hope to continue developing a new estimator with some correctness guarantees (e.g., upper/error bounds).
